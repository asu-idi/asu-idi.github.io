In the big data era, speeding up query performance is crucial. We focus on designing novel indexing structures and storage-memory co-designs to enhance query speed, particularly in scientific computing, big data analytics, and ML systems.

To achieve these goals, we are focusing on several key strategies:

- Novel Indexing Structures: Developing advanced indexing methods to organize and access data more efficiently.
- Storage-Memory Co-Designs: Integrating storage and memory optimizations to reduce latency and speed up data retrieval.
- Application Focus: Enhancing query performance specifically in scientific computing, big data analytics, and ML systems.
