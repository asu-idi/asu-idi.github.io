Zhichao Cao is an assistant professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University. He leads the Intelligent Data Infrastructure (IDI) research lab, where he conducts research in the areas of database systems (e.g., key-value stores, graph databases, and timeseries databases), storage systems (e.g., file systems, cloud storage, and deduplication systems), and next-generation data infrastructure (e.g., disaggregated infrastructure, computing-in-X, and wireless datacenter). His research interests also lie in the design and development of data management systems for new memory and storage technologies, such as SMR, IMR, NVM, CXL, RDMA, ZNS, and DNA. Moreover, Prof. Cao's research also encompasses big data systems, with a focus on the development of query engines for large-scale scientific computing in HPC and storage solutions for AI/ML platforms.

Prior to joining ASU, Prof. Cao worked as a research scientist at Facebook, where he contributed to storage and database research from 2018 to 2021. He earned his bachelor's degree in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2013 and his doctoral degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, in 2020.
