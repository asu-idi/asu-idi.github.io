    LSM-KVS (e.g., RocksDB) is a key component in today’s data infrastructure for storing unstructured data. Initially designed for legacy monolithic servers, it now faces issues like resource wasting and low scalability as workloads grow. Deploying LSM-KVS in a disaggregated infrastructure is essential for better performance and resource management. Our vision is to fully restructure LSM-KVS, decouple the components, and execute them at different disaggregated compute, memory, and storage nodes for better performance, resource utilization, and management capability. Remote compaction, remote flush, and offloading the block cache are just the beginning.
